DESCRIPTION:<i>Gido M van de Ven\, Hava Siegelmann\, and Andreas Tolias</i>
 <br><br>Artificial neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Unl
 ike humans\,when these networks are trained on something new\, they rapidly
  forget what waslearned before. In the brain\, a mechanism thought to be im
 portant for protectingmemories is the replay of neuronal activity patterns 
 representing those memories.In artificial neural networks\, such memory rep
 lay has been implemented in theform of ‘generative replay’\, which can succ
 essfully prevent catastrophic forgetting in a range of toy examples. Scalin
 g up generative replay to problems withmore complex inputs\, however\, turn
 s out to be challenging. We propose a new\,more brain-like variant of repla
 y in which internal or hidden representations arereplayed that are generate
 d by the network’s own\, context-modulated feedbackconnections. In contrast
  to established continual learning methods\, our methodachieves acceptable 
 performance on the challenging problem of class-incrementallearning on natu
 ral images without relying on stored data.

DESCRIPTION:<i>Eliza Kosoy\, Jasmine Collins\, David Chan\, Jessica Hamrick
 \, Sandy H Huang\, John F Canny\, and Alison Gopnik<br></i><br>Research in 
 developmental psychology consistently shows that children explorethe world 
 thoroughly and efficiently and that this exploration allows them to learn.I
 n turn\, this early learning supports more robust generalization and intell
 igent behavior later in life. While much work has gone into developing meth
 ods for exploration in machine learning\, artificial agents have not yet re
 ached the high standardset by their human counterparts. In this work we pro
 pose using DeepMind Lab(Beattie et al.\, 2016) as a platform to directly co
 mpare child and agent behaviorsand to develop new exploration techniques. W
 e outline two ongoing experimentsto demonstrate the effectiveness of a dire
 ct comparison\, and outline a number ofopen research questions that we beli
 eve can be tested using this methodology.

DESCRIPTION:<i>Angela Radulescu\, Bas van Opheusden\, Frederick Callaway\, 
 Thomas Griffiths\, and James Hillis</i><br><br>Effective use of limited com
 putational resources is a hallmark of intelligent systems. Here we explore 
 how people make use of limited perceptual resources ina naturalistic visual
  search task. We hypothesize that people optimally trade offperformance aga
 inst the cost of sampling information. To formalize this hypothesis\, we fr
 ame the problem of attention allocation in visual search as a meta-levelMar
 kov decision process (meta-MDP) and show that a classic Bayesian model ofvi
 sual search can be interpreted as a heuristic policy for this meta-MDP. We 
 testthe heuristic policy against gaze data from 21 human participants in a 
 virtual reality (VR) visual search study\, finding that human gaze trajecto
 ries share qualitativestructure with trajectories simulated from the model.

DESCRIPTION:<i>Hyunwoo Kim\, Byeongchang Kim\, and Gunhee Kim</i><br><br>Al
 though consistency has been a long-standing issue in dialogue agents\, we s
 howbest-performing persona-conditioned generative models still suffer from 
 high insensitivity to contradiction. Current approaches for improving consi
 stency rely onsupervised external models and labels which are demanding. In
 spired by socialcognition and pragmatics\, we model public self-consciousne
 ss in dialogue agentsthrough an imaginary listener to improve consistency. 
 Our approach\, based on theRational Speech Acts framework (Frank &amp\; Goo
 dman\, 2012)\, attempts to maintainconsistency in an unsupervised manner re
 quiring neither additional annotationsnor pretrained external models. We fu
 rther extend the framework by learningthe distractor supply for the first t
 ime. Experimental results show that our approach effectively reduces contra
 diction and improves consistency on DialogueNLI (Welleck et al.\, 2019) and
  PersonaChat (Zhang et al.\, 2018).
