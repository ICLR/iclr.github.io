DESCRIPTION:<br><b>Abstract:</b> Despite their wide applicability\, many de
 ep networks often fail to exactly capture simple "known" features of real-w
 orld data sets\, such as those governed by physical laws.&nbsp\; In this ta
 lk\, I'll present methods for integrating constraints such as physical simu
 lation requirements <i>directly</i> into the predictions of a deep network.
 &nbsp\; Our tool for doing this will be the use of so-called implicit layer
 s in deep models\, layers that are defined implicitly in terms of condition
 s we would like them to satisfy\, rather than via an explicit computation g
 raph.&nbsp\; I'll discuss how we can use these layers to embed (exact) phys
 ical simulation within deep networks\, discuss several related approaches\,
  and highlight directions for future work.<br><br><b>Speaker Bio:</b> Zico 
 Kolter is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at Carn
 egie Mellon University\, and also serves as chief scientist of AI research 
 for the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence. His work spans the inters
 ection of machine learning and optimization\, with a large focus on develop
 ing more robust and rigorous methods in deep learning. In addition\, he has
  worked in a number of application areas\, highlighted by work on sustainab
 ility and smart energy systems. He is a recipient of the DARPA Young Facult
 y Award\, a Sloan Fellowship\, and best paper awards at NeurIPS\, ICML (hon
 orable mention)\, IJCAI\, KDD\, and PESGM.

DESCRIPTION:The built infrastructure is a critical component of climate pol
 icies\, both because of the large energy use of buildings and because of vu
 lnerability to extreme weather events. However\, access to good data about 
 buildings can be a bottleneck in designing effective policies. Machine lear
 ning can contribute to a sustainable and resilient built infrastructure by 
 gathering individual data on millions of buildings. This session will discu
 ss ways to monitor infrastructure with remote sensing\, and to upscale buil
 ding energy use modeling to the city scale.<p>Speakers:</p><ul><li><a href=

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title:</b> Measuring Economic Development from Space with Ma
 chine Learning<br><br><b>Abstract:</b> Recent technological developments ar
 e creating new spatio-temporal data streams that contain a wealth of inform
 ation relevant to climate adaptation strategies. Modern AI techniques have 
 the potential to yield accurate\, inexpensive\, and highly scalable models 
 to inform research and policy. A key challenge\, however\, is the lack of l
 arge quantities of labeled data that often characterize successful machine 
 learning applications. In this talk\, I will present new approaches for lea
 rning useful spatio-temporal models in contexts where labeled training data
  is scarce or not available at all. I will show applications to predict and
  map poverty in developing countries\, monitor  agricultural productivity a
 nd food security outcomes\, and map infrastructure access in Africa. Our me
 thods can reliably predict economic well-being using only high-resolution s
 atellite imagery. Because images are passively collected in every corner of
  the world\, our methods can provide timely and accurate measurements in a 
 very scalable end economic way\, and could significantly improve the effect
 iveness of climate adaptation efforts.<br><br><b>Speaker Bio:</b> Stefano E

 : using ML to protect and restore ecosystems&nbsp\;</p><p><u></u></p><p><b>
 Abstract:&nbsp\;</b>When we think “ML for climate change”\, we often think 
 of climate forecasting\, energy grid optimization\, greenhouse gas reductio
 n\, and other opportunities for ML to impact the&nbsp\;<i>direct&nbsp\;</i>
 causes and effects of global warming. But in this talk\, I will present the
  close relationships among&nbsp\;<i>climate</i>\,&nbsp\;<i>biodiversity</i>
 \, and&nbsp\;<i>land use</i>\, and I will discuss opportunities for ML to s
 upport climate change mitigation by accelerating efforts in all three of th
 ese areas. Furthermore\, this workshop’s mission states that “many in the M
 L community wish to take action on climate change\, yet feel their skills a
 re inapplicable”\; I hope to convince the audience that one of the best way
 s we can put ML to work – and often the easiest way for ML students and pra
 ctitioners to get hands-on experience with environmental sustainability – i
 s to focus on some of the “small” problems whose solutions will make the da
 y-to-day work of conservation scientists and practitioners more efficient.<

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title:</b>&nbsp\;Why the Climate Change AI Community Should 
 Care About Weather? A New Approach for Africa<br><br><b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp\
 ;By improving weather services in Africa\, we have the potential to unlock 
 hundreds billions of dollars of opportunity for the continent\, and\, in tu
 rn\, lift millions from poverty by helping individuals\, businesses and gov
 ernments proactively manage weather risk and adapt to changing weather patt
 erns. While there have been significant technological advancements in weath
 er forecasting globally  in recent years through the use of supercomputers\
 , AI and user-facing tools\, these benefits are yet to reach their full pot
 ential in Africa.<br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\; &nbsp\; &nbsp\; During this presentati
 on for the Climate Change AI community\, Georgina shares ClimaCell’s novel 
 approach to bringing weather innovations to Africa’s hydro-met value chain.
  Through a set of powerful stories\, she shares a community-level perspecti
 ve of the game-changing socio-economic value that could be achieved with be
 tter forecasts\, especially among vulnerable communities. She presents a ne
 w systems lense for how to view this opportunity by better understanding th
 e problem\, with the goal of inspiring the Climate Change AI community to c
 ontribute to this critical\, but perhaps underappreciated\, aspect of the c
 limate adaptation agenda. Weather can drive people into poverty. Knowing th
 e weather can lift them out.<br>&nbsp\; &nbsp\; &nbsp\; &nbsp\; Georgina Ca
 mpbell Flatter will be joined by her colleague Daniel Rothenberg for the Q&
 amp\;A portion of this talk.<br><br><p><strong>Speaker Bio:</strong>&nbsp\;
 Georgina Campbell Flatter leads ClimaCell’s emerging market activities\, an
 d is dedicated to ensuring that every human being on earth can benefit from
  the socio-economic opportunities of high quality accessible weather inform
 ation\, especially vulnerable communities. Prior to ClimaCell\, Georgina sp
 ent a decade at MIT where her research and teaching centered around the rol
 e of business and entrepreneurship in tackling large systemic poverty issue
 s. She was a Senior Lecturer with the Technological Innovation\, Entreprene
 urship and Strategic Management Group at MIT Sloan. Through this role\, she
  developed several new academic courses and co-wrote cases on game-changing
  principled leaders and ventures working in emerging markets. She also serv
 ed as Executive Director of the MIT Legatum Center for Development and Entr
 epreneurship and\, prior to that\, Director of MIT’s Regional Entrepreneurs
 hip Acceleration Program (REAP). She began her journey at MIT making gecko-
 inspired surgical adhesives at the MIT Langer Lab and hydrogen-generating n
 anoparticles at an MIT cleantech spinout. Some of her thoughts on entrepren
 eurship are captured in pieces recently published in the FT\, Entrepreneur.
 com\, and Forbes. She read Material Science at Trinity College Oxford and T
 echnology and Policy at MIT.</p><strong>Additional Speaker Bio:</strong>&nb
 sp\;As an atmospheric scientist\, Daniel Rothenberg’s research interests fo
 cus on applying new technology and techniques to solve challenging problems
  in meteorology and climate science. During his doctoral work at MIT\, Dr. 
 Rothenberg developed and applied new modeling approaches for improving the 
 fidelity of aerosol-cloud interactions inside global climate models\; later
  on at MIT in the Institute for Data Systems and Society\, he studied the i
 ntersection of climate change\, air quality\, and policy by working to quan
 tify the “time of emergence” of climate-forced air quality impacts and the 
 policy co-benefits of mitigating them. Throughout these experiences\, he ha
 s played a hands-on role in developing weather (WRF)\, climate (CESM/IGSM)\
 , and chemical transport (GEOS-Chem) models. Currently\, Dr. Rothenberg ser
 ves as the Chief Scientist of ClimaCell\, a weather technology start-up\, l
 eading their R&amp\;D and engineering initiatives towards building novel te
 chnology for integrating micro-weather observations into large-scale weathe
 r analysis\, forecast\, and nowcasting systems.

DESCRIPTION:<strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp\;In this talk we examine the th
 e human cost of climate change and explore a number of technological interv
 entions aimed at improving the monitoring of ecosystems. In particular we f
 ocus on the use of bioacoustic approaches to environmental monitoring and d
 escribe efforts currently underway in Kenya to develop a decision support s
 ystem for ecosystem management that uses audio recordings collected in the 
 ecosystems of interest to infer ecosystem health. We also explore the use o
 f internet of things for water resource monitoring and improved agriculture
  which are essential if we are to lessen the impact of climate change on vu
 lnerable communities.<p><strong>Speaker Bio:</strong>&nbsp\;Ciira wa Maina
