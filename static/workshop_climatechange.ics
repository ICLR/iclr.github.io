DESCRIPTION:<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk we examine the the huma
 n cost of climate change and explore a number of technological intervention
 s aimed at improving the monitoring of ecosystems. In particular we focus o
 n the use of bioacoustic approaches to environmental monitoring and describ
 e efforts currently underway in Kenya to develop a decision support system 
 for ecosystem management that uses audio recordings collected in the ecosys
 tems of interest to infer ecosystem health. We also explore the use of inte
 rnet of things for water resource monitoring and improved agriculture which
  are essential if we are to lessen the impact of climate change on vulnerab
 le communities.<p><strong>Speaker Bio:</strong> Ciira wa Maina graduated fr

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title:</b> Why the Climate Change AI Community Should Care A
 bout Weather? A New Approach for Africa<br><br><b>Abstract:</b> By improvin
 g weather services in Africa\, we have the potential to unlock hundreds bil
 lions of dollars of opportunity for the continent\, and\, in turn\, lift mi
 llions from poverty by helping individuals\, businesses and governments pro
 actively manage weather risk and adapt to changing weather patterns. While 
 there have been significant technological advancements in weather forecasti
 ng globally  in recent years through the use of supercomputers\, AI and use
 r-facing tools\, these benefits are yet to reach their full potential in Af
 rica.<br>        During this presentation for the Climate Change AI communi
 ty\, Georgina shares ClimaCell’s novel approach to bringing weather innovat
 ions to Africa’s hydro-met value chain. Through a set of powerful stories\,
  she shares a community-level perspective of the game-changing socio-econom
 ic value that could be achieved with better forecasts\, especially among vu
 lnerable communities. She presents a new systems lense for how to view this
  opportunity by better understanding the problem\, with the goal of inspiri
 ng the Climate Change AI community to contribute to this critical\, but per
 haps underappreciated\, aspect of the climate adaptation agenda. Weather ca
 n drive people into poverty. Knowing the weather can lift them out.<br>    
     Georgina Campbell Flatter will be joined by her colleague Daniel Rothen
 berg for the Q&amp\;A portion of this talk.<br><br><p><strong>Speaker Bio:<

 trong> As an atmospheric scientist\, Daniel Rothenberg’s research interests
  focus on applying new technology and techniques to solve challenging probl
 ems in meteorology and climate science. During his doctoral work at MIT\, D
 r. Rothenberg developed and applied new modeling approaches for improving t
 he fidelity of aerosol-cloud interactions inside global climate models\; la
 ter on at MIT in the Institute for Data Systems and Society\, he studied th
 e intersection of climate change\, air quality\, and policy by working to q
 uantify the “time of emergence” of climate-forced air quality impacts and t
 he policy co-benefits of mitigating them. Throughout these experiences\, he
  has played a hands-on role in developing weather (WRF)\, climate (CESM/IGS
 M)\, and chemical transport (GEOS-Chem) models. Currently\, Dr. Rothenberg 
 serves as the Chief Scientist of ClimaCell\, a weather technology start-up\
 , leading their R&amp\;D and engineering initiatives towards building novel
  technology for integrating micro-weather observations into large-scale wea
 ther analysis\, forecast\, and nowcasting systems.

DESCRIPTION:<b>Title:</b> Measuring Economic Development from Space with Ma
 chine Learning<br><br><b>Abstract:</b> Recent technological developments ar
 e creating new spatio-temporal data streams that contain a wealth of inform
 ation relevant to climate adaptation strategies. Modern AI techniques have 
 the potential to yield accurate\, inexpensive\, and highly scalable models 
 to inform research and policy. A key challenge\, however\, is the lack of l
 arge quantities of labeled data that often characterize successful machine 
 learning applications. In this talk\, I will present new approaches for lea
 rning useful spatio-temporal models in contexts where labeled training data
  is scarce or not available at all. I will show applications to predict and
  map poverty in developing countries\, monitor  agricultural productivity a
 nd food security outcomes\, and map infrastructure access in Africa. Our me
 thods can reliably predict economic well-being using only high-resolution s
 atellite imagery. Because images are passively collected in every corner of
  the world\, our methods can provide timely and accurate measurements in a 
 very scalable end economic way\, and could significantly improve the effect
 iveness of climate adaptation efforts.<br><br><b>Speaker Bio:</b> Stefano E

 b>When we think “ML for climate change”\, we often think of climate forecas

 ce that one of the best ways we can put ML to work – and often the easiest 
 way for ML students and practitioners to get hands-on experience with envir
 onmental sustainability – is to focus on some of the “small” problems whose
  solutions will make the day-to-day work of conservation scientists and pra
