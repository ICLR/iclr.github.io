      day: Tuesday, Thursday
      description: "Appropriate tooling is an inevitable part of the SOTA deep learning research. Recent advancements in the field resulted in the proliferation of large frameworks’ ecosystems (TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet) as well as smaller targeted tools that serve specific needs. This social event is centered around all the tools and practices, big and small, that are relevant to the ICLR community. Participants are encouraged to show their own open source tools that they build, regardless of their size and proliferation level. It can be a single CLI command that you find useful or an entire framework. Main goal for the participants is to introduce them to the wide range of tools and practices that may result in faster research progression and standardization."

    - name: Generative ML for Generalization
      organizers: "Prabhu Pradhan & Mehdi S. M. Sajjadi"
      day: Tuesday
      description: "Deep Generative Models (DGM) have become spectacularly popular even outside the research circles. Despite their success, we do not see deeper insights on their usage as a tool for generalization (i.e. better representations via data enhancement, augmentation etc).
Since ICLR does not have a workshop on DGM, this event will provide a platform for the enthusiast community."

      description: "In 2019, OpenAI adopted a staged release approach for their advanced language model GPT-2, citing concerns around potential misuses of the model. Earlier this year, NeurIPS announced a submission requirement for authors to include a broader impact statement about possible consequences of their research. As ML becomes increasingly advanced and ubiquitous, we are challenged with anticipating the consequences of our research and mitigating risks of malicious use, harmful applications, unintended consequences, and accidents. But while ML researchers may experts in their own domain, how can they accurately predict the economic, political, and sociological impacts of their work, especially when they might be second or third order effects? Should risk screening be the researcher's responsibility? If not theirs, whose? What structural incentives are at play that affect our ability to publish responsibly? How can we improve publication practices in the field to maximize the benefits of research while mitigating risks? Join us for a discussion on these questions and more, hosted by the Partnership on AI. All levels of familiarity/experience welcome!

      description: "Four broad applications of ML in Cybersecurity are related to Malware Detection, Anomaly Detection, User Behavior Modeling, and Adversarial ML. The ICLR research community continues to produce exciting work that can be of relevance to both researchers and practitioners in Cybersecurity. E.g., ideas from Network Representation Learning can be applied to Cyber Terrain graphs, that capture complex relationship between connected devices, to develop robust approaches for detecting insider threat and compromised assets. Similarly, learning low dimensional representations of the large volume and variety of data generated by executing different types of malware in a sandbox experiment can lead to better malware detection algorithms. It is also worth probing how to adapt the Adversarial ML work done in the domain of Computer Vision for Cybersecurity problems. "

      description: "The COVID-19 coronavirus presents an unprecedented, global challenge. When citizens are doing their part by social distancing, healthcare workers and first responders are taking care of many of us, and our governments are mobilizing resources to respond to this crisis, we’ve asked ourselves what can we do at IBM, and more generally, what can the AI community contribute? In this social event, we will provide an overview of the AI tools IBM offered to help the research community fight against COVID-19 (see our response at <a href='https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/covid19/'>https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/covid19/</a>). We will open the floor and use this opportunity to brainstorm novel together with ICLR participants"

Inspired by Wine and Cheese seminars at many institutions, this BYOWC (Bring Your Own Wine and Cheese) event is an informal opportunity to connect with members of the community.  Hear how others made the transition between fields. Discuss how your physics training prepared you to switch fields, what synergies between physics and machine learning excite you the most. Share your favorite physics jokes your computer science colleagues don't get, and just meet other cool people. Open to everyone, not only physicists; you'll just have to tolerate our humor.  Wine and Cheese encouraged, but not required."

This social will be composed of multiple breakout rooms, each hosted by a senior researcher in the field who will moderate the conversation and share their thoughts.  The discussion topic in each room will be dynamically determined by the participants, and may change along with the conversation.  Conversation topics in the breakout rooms may include questions like When should we learn on a real robot?, How to evaluate Model-Based RL methods?, How do we learn third-person imitation and movement analogies?, What can we learn about learning from motor development?, How should we represent tactile information?. This social will be an opportunity to engage with members of the community who care about robotics and embodied intelligence.  We aim to create an inclusive space to share early ideas, with the hope of inspiring novel research and fostering new collaborations."
