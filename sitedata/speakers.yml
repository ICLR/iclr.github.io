      title:  "AI + Africa = Global Innovation"
      image: static/images/aisha.jpg
      institution: IBM Research Africa, Nairobi
      day: Monday
      id: 1
      abstract: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has for some time stoked the creative fires of computer scientists and researchers world-wide -- even before the so-called AI winter. After emerging from the winter, with much improved compute, vast amounts of data, and new techniques, AI has ignited our collective imaginations. We have been captivated by its promise while wary of its possible misuse in applications. AI has certainly demonstrated its enormous potential especially in fields such as healthcare. There, it has been used to support radiologists and to further precision medicine; conversely it has been used to generate photorealistic videos which distort our concept of what is real.  Hence, we must thoughtfully harness AI to address the myriad of scientific and societal challenges; and open pathways to opportunities in governance, policy, and management. In this talk, I will share innovative solutions which leverage AI for global health with a focus on Africa. I will present a vision for the collaborations in hopes to inspire our community to join on this journey to transform Africa and impact the world."

      institution: MIT
      day: Monday
      id: 2
      abstract: "We, as robot engineers, have to think hard about our role in the design of robots and how it interacts with learning, both in 'the factory' (that is, at engineering time) and in 'the wild' (that is, when the robot is delivered to a customer). I will share some general thoughts about the strategies for robot design and then talk in detail about some work I have been involved in, both in the design of an overall architecture for an intelligent robot and in strategies for learning to integrate new skills into the repertoire of an already competent robot."

      title: "2020 Vision: Reimagining the Default Settings of Technology & Society"
      image: static/images/ruha.jpeg
      institution: Princeton
      day: Tuesday
      id: 3
      abstract: "From everyday apps to complex algorithms, technology has the potential to hide, speed, and even deepen discrimination, while appearing neutral and even benevolent when compared to racist practices of a previous era. In this talk, I explore a range of discriminatory designs that encode inequity: by explicitly amplifying racial hierarchies, by ignoring but thereby replicating social divisions, or by aiming to fix racial bias but ultimately doing quite the opposite. This presentation takes us into the world of biased bots, altruistic algorithms, and their many entanglements, and provides conceptual tools to decode tech promises with sociologically informed skepticism. In doing so, it challenges us to question not only the technologies we are sold, but also the ones we manufacture ourselves."
      bio: "Dr. Ruha Benjamin is Associate Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, founder of the JUST DATA Lab, and author of People’s Science: Bodies and Rights on the Stem Cell Frontier (2013) and Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code (2019) among other publications. Her work investigates the social dimensions of science, medicine, and technology with a focus on the relationship between innovation and inequity, health and justice, knowledge and power.

      abstract: "Normalizing flows provide a tool to build an expressive and tractable family of probability distributions. In the last few years, research in this field has successfully harnessed some of the latest advances in deep learning to design flexible invertible models. Recently, these methods have seen wider adoption in the machine learning community for applications such as probabilistic inference, density estimation, and classification. In this talk, I will reflect on the recent progress made by the community on using, expanding, and repurposing this toolset, and describe my perspective on challenges and opportunities in this direction."

      abstract: "While there has been significant progress at the interface of statistics and computer science in recent years, many fundamental challenges remain. Some are mathematical and algorithmic in nature, such as the challenges associated with optimization and sampling in high-dimensional spaces. Some are statistical, including the challenges associated with multiple decision-making. Others are economic in nature, including the need to cope with scarcity and provide incentives in learning-based two-way markets. I will present recent progress on each of these fronts."
